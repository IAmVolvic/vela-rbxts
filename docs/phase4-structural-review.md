# Phase 4 design review — structural transform utilities (`m-*`, `divide-*`)

> **Status**: 4.1 (margin, option C) is implemented. When it overlaps with
> transitions, layout props routed to the wrapper apply immediately without a tween
> in v1 (wrapper-ref tweens come later).
> 4.2 (divide) is implemented too — with exactly the design and constraints from this
> review (LayoutOrder, gap approximation).

Phase 4 covers the utilities that do not change one element's properties but
**have to change the render tree itself**. This review compares implementation
strategies and settles on a recommendation.

## Summary of conclusions

| Item | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| `m-*` implementation strategy | **Option C: the runtime host renders the wrapper** (not compile-time tree surgery) |
| margin support scope | `m/mx/my/mt/mr/mb/ml-*` plus negatives; `mx-auto` keeps the existing anchor approach |
| `divide-x/y-*` | **Feasible** with the same host mechanism, but split off as Phase 4.2 and done after margin settles |
| `space-x-reverse` and friends | Still unsupported (value diagnostic retained) |

## 1. `m-*` margin

### Settled semantics

Emulate the CSS margin box directly: **transparent wrapper frame = margin box**,
inner element = border box. UIPadding expresses the margin values.

```
wrapper(frame, transparent, Size = declared Size + margin sum)
 ├─ uipadding (PaddingTop/Right/Bottom/Left = margin)
 └─ inner(the original element, Size = fromScale(1, 1))
```

- Inside a list (UIListLayout): the wrapper becomes the list item, so the margin adds
  to the spacing between items — same as CSS. Document that it stacks with `gap`.
- Absolute positioning: in CSS `left` is measured from the margin edge, so moving
  Position/AnchorPoint to the wrapper matches CSS semantics exactly.
- Negative margins: UIPadding does not support negative values, so **negative margins
  are handled without a wrapper, purely as a Position offset shift** (joining the same
  pending path as translate). When mixed with a wrapper plus positive margins, they
  are computed and merged per axis.

### Size formula

| Inner declaration | Wrapper Size | Inner Size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `w-40` (offset 160) | `UDim2(0, 160+ml+mr, …)` | `fromScale(1,1)` |
| `w-1/2` (scale 0.5) | `UDim2(0.5, ml+mr, …)` | `fromScale(1,1)` |
| `w-auto` | wrapper is `AutomaticSize` too, inner stays auto | auto |

Margin values come from the spacing scale, so they are always offsets — the formula
is pure addition. Scale margins do not exist, so there is no case explosion.

### Strategy comparison

**Option A — compile-time tree surgery (JSX wrapping in swc)**
- Pro: no host cost for static elements.
- Con: user prop routing has to happen **at compile time**. AST surgery to move
  dynamic attrs like `Size={expr}` and `LayoutOrder={props.i}` onto the wrapper, key
  migration, cases where an `md:w-*` runtime rule must change the wrapper size (a
  static wrapper cannot follow), branching the transition/animate ref target — a large
  implementation surface with many edge cases.

**Option B — no wrapper, only a Position shift**
- Rejected, since it gives up margin's main use case (list spacing). One could argue
  `space-*` already absorbed that demand — but then there is no reason to build
  option B at all.

**Option C — the runtime host renders the wrapper (recommended)**
- When `m-*` is present, **promote to the host** just like `animate-*` and pass
  `__velaMargin = {top,right,bottom,left}`. The host wraps with
  `createElement("frame", wrapperProps, createElement(tag, innerProps, …))`.
- Prop routing collapses to **a single runtime table**: dynamic or static, user props
  have already arrived as props, so no AST surgery is needed.
- When an `md:` rule changes the size, resolution is recomputed and the wrapper
  formula is recomputed with it — option A's hardest problem is solved for free.
- Cost: static margin elements become hosts too. The extra instance is a single
  wrapper frame, identical to option A; only one component layer is added. Acceptable.

### Option C prop routing table (the key output)

| To the wrapper | To the inner element |
| --- | --- |
| `Size` (with the formula applied), `Position`, `AnchorPoint`, `LayoutOrder`, `ZIndex`, `Visible`, `key` | Everything else: colors/transparency, the text family, `ref`, events (`Event`/`Change`/handlers), helper children (uicorner, etc.) |
| `AutomaticSize` (both, when the inner is auto) | `ClipsDescendants` |

- forwardRef/`instanceRef` (the tween/animate target) points at the **inner element**.
  However, props that a transition tweens but which route to the wrapper
  (Position/Size) have to tween the wrapper instance, so a separate wrapper ref is
  captured too — `splitTweenGoal` is split in two along the routing table.
- `mx-auto` + `m-*` combined: the centering (AnchorPoint/Position) applies to the
  wrapper.
- Component elements (`<Switch.Root className="m-4">`) work as well: the host creates
  the wrapper and the inner is a component render, so no instance access is needed.
  Unlike motion, there is no component restriction.

### Diagnostics

- Combinations where the formula is undefined, such as negative `-m-*` with an auto
  size → value diagnostic.
- Margin plus `basis`/`size-*` and friends fall out of the formula naturally, so no
  extra diagnostic is needed.

### Test plan

- transform: `__velaMargin` serialization, host promotion, the negative-margin pending
  path.
- The runtime logic is verified in rbxts-harness by pattern-matching the wrapper
  structure in the emitted Luau (transparent frame + uipadding + fromScale(1,1)).
  Manual Studio item: margin spacing inside a list.
- lattice regression: confirm `<Switch.Root className="m-4">` compiles (reusing the
  archived lattice-compat harness).

## 2. `divide-x/y-*` (Phase 4.2)

### Design

The host's `normalizeChildren` already flattens children, so having the host insert a
separator frame between each pair of children is an extension of the same mechanism:

```
[a, b, c] → [a, sep, b, sep, c]
sep = frame(Size: (0,N,1,0) for divide-x, (1,0,0,N) for divide-y, BackgroundColor3 = divide color)
```

- `divide-x-N` (0/1/2/4/8, default 1) → thickness, `divide-{color}` → color (theme
  resolution reuses the existing color resolver).
- Conditional children (`cond && <frame/>`) are already filtered out by
  normalizeChildren, so the separator count works out automatically.

### Constraints (must be documented)

- **If children use explicit `LayoutOrder`, the separator order breaks** — under
  UIListLayout sorting the separators (default 0) land in the wrong place. This case
  cannot be detected, so the hover text and docs state: "do not use divide on a list
  that uses LayoutOrder".
- Separators are list items too, so `gap` applies on both sides of each separator —
  unlike CSS (where divide is a border and independent of gap). Document that this is
  an approximation.

### Judgment

The implementation is easier than margin option C (just child-array manipulation), but
demand is uncertain and the LayoutOrder constraint can surprise users. Recommendation:
**do it after margin settles, in the same host release cycle**. For now the `divide`
family stays in no-roblox-equivalent.

## Open decisions

1. Whether to approve margin option C (host wrapper) — on approval, start Phase 4.1.
2. Whether to include divide in 4.1 or defer to 4.2 (recommendation: 4.2).
