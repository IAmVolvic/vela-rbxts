# Vide support design

Design for making Vela emit for [Vide](https://centau.github.io/vide/) — the
`@rbxts/vide` port maintained at [littensy/vide](https://github.com/littensy/vide) —
alongside the React target it emits for today.

Scope agreed for v1: **phases 0–4**. Motion (`transition-*`, `animate-*`) was deferred
to a follow-up and landed in the parity pass (§9). Runtime packaging is a
**three-package split**, decided up front.

## 1. What is actually different

Vide's JSX intrinsics are `[K in keyof CreatableInstances as Lowercase<K>]`, the same
lowercase Roblox class names `@rbxts/react` uses, and its props are Roblox instance
properties directly. A statically lowered element —
`<frame BackgroundColor3={...}><uipadding/><uicorner/></frame>` — is valid, identical
source under both targets. The static path is therefore close to free.

The reactivity model is where the two diverge.

| | React (`@rbxts/react`) | Vide |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Re-render | Yes | **No** — a component body runs once |
| Dynamic prop | Plain value, refreshed by re-render | `Derivable<T> = T \| (() => T)` — **must be a thunk to be tracked** |
| State | `useState` | `source()` |
| Effects | `useEffect` | `effect()` / `cleanup()` |
| Context | `createContext` + Provider | `context()` + `<Provider>` whose children is `() => Node` |
| Instance handle | `forwardRef` / `ref` | no ref — `action?: (instance: T) => void` |
| Conditional children | Re-render | `<Show>` / `<Switch>`, or imperative |
| Animation | External driver | built-in `spring()` |

Vide's `Vide.Attributes { children?: Node }` is the exact analogue of the
`React.Attributes` seam Vela augments today: `ActionAttributes extends Attributes`
carries it to every intrinsic, and `JSX.IntrinsicAttributes extends Vide.Attributes`
carries it to every component.

## 2. Where the current code is React-coupled

Reused unchanged:

- `packages/compiler/src/semantic/`, `utilities/`, `config/`, `ir/`, `class_value/` —
  the whole token → `StyleIr` pipeline
- `packages/compiler/src/editor/` — the LSP needs no target awareness
- `packages/config`, `packages/core`, `packages/ir`, `packages/types`

Coupled:

| Location | Coupling |
| --- | --- |
| `transform/runtime_host.rs` | `createVelaRuntimeHost` import preamble and module specifier |
| `transform/context.rs` | builds the host JSX element |
| `swc/builders.rs` `create_tests_attr` | emits `[cond ? true : false]`; Vide needs thunks |
| `swc/builders.rs` `create_opacity_provider` | emits a React context provider element |
| `transform/rem.rs` | `__VelaRem.udim2(v, slot)` returns a React `Binding` — the one React dependency on the *static* path |
| `transform/fade.rs` | `cloneElement`-based fade |
| `packages/runtime/src/index.ts` | 5797 lines, but only **45 React call sites**, concentrated in the `forwardRef` host body, `__VelaEnv`, `__VelaOpacity`, and the margin/divide/padding `createElement` calls |

## 3. Decisions

### D1 — Compiler: an `EmitTarget` seam under `transform`

The semantic layer is already target-neutral; only the IR → JSX bake diverges.

Landed in `src/transform/target/` as:

```rust
trait EmitTarget {
    fn runtime_module_items(&self, config: &TailwindConfig, needs: &RuntimeNeeds<'_>) -> Vec<ModuleItem>;
    fn host_element_name(&self) -> &'static str;
    fn tests_attr(&self, tests: Vec<Expr>) -> JSXAttrOrSpread;
    fn opacity_provider(&self, alpha: f64, children: Vec<JSXElementChild>) -> Box<JSXElement>;
    fn fade_element(&self, child: Expr) -> Box<JSXElement>;
}
```

`VelaTransformer` carries a `&'static dyn EmitTarget`. Everything else in
`swc/builders.rs` — props, casts, helper children — stayed shared, because Vide reads
the same host tags and Roblox property names React does.

### D2 — Runtime: three packages

| Package | Contents | Peer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@rbxts/vela-runtime-core` | resolution engine, theme normalization, rem math, rich text, margin/divide computation | none |
| `@rbxts/vela-runtime` | React host (name kept for compatibility) | `@rbxts/react` |
| `@rbxts/vela-runtime-vide` | Vide host | `@rbxts/vide` |

Luau has no tree shaking, so a shared root index would drag React into every Vide
project. Separate packages remove the resolution question entirely; the compiler picks
the specifier per target.

The Vide host is not a re-rendering component but a factory that wires effects once:

```
VelaVideHost(props) →
  hovered / pressed / focused = source(false)
  create(tag)({
    ...static props,
    ...each resolved prop as a () => resolve(...)[prop] thunk,
    MouseEnter / MouseLeave / InputBegan composed with the user's handlers,
    action: (instance) => wire margin / divide / cleanup(),
  })
```

Things the React host reaches through `instanceRef` are simpler here, because the Vide
host holds the instance directly.

### D3 — Target selection: config, with tsconfig inference

`jsxFactory` is a program-wide setting, so React and Vide cannot be mixed in one
project. Selection is per project:

```ts
defineConfig({ framework: "vide" })  // default "react"
```

When unset, `packages/rbxtsc-host/src/project-config.ts` infers from the tsconfig
`jsxFactory` (`Vide.jsx` → `vide`). Per-file import sniffing is deliberately not done:
it buys nothing and surprises.

## 4. The hard parts

**Reactive boundary.** In React, `className={active ? "a" : "b"}` refreshes by
re-render. In Vide the user must write `className={() => active() ? "a" : "b"}`. The
compiler has to unwrap that arrow before branch lowering and re-wrap each test as a
thunk: `__velaTests={[() => cond ? true : false]}`. One unwrap step in
`class_value/collapse.rs`, plus `EmitTarget::tests_attr`.

**Rem bindings.** Resolved by phase 0 — see below. The emit is unchanged; only the
scaler's return type differs.

**Opacity context and fade.** Vide's `<Provider context={} value={}>{() => children}</Provider>`
takes a thunk for children, so the emitted element shape differs. `cloneElement` in
`fade.rs` becomes `Vide.apply(instance)({...})`.

**Conditional helper children.** A `uistroke` that only exists under `hover:` cannot be
re-rendered into place; the Vide host creates and destroys it imperatively under
`cleanup()`. Landed differently — see §8.

## 5. Phases

| Phase | Work | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0. Spike | minimal `apps/vide-harness`; verify hand-written lowering output runs in Studio | **done** |
| 1. `EmitTarget` seam | introduce the trait with `ReactTarget`; zero behavior change | **done** |
| 2. Runtime split | extract `-core`, rebuild the React host on it; zero behavior change | medium — touches release plumbing |
| 3. Vide host (MVP) | static lowering, runtime `className` resolution, rem. No variants | **done** |
| 4. Reactive boundary | arrow unwrap, thunked tests, hover/pressed/focused, opacity context, margin/divide | **done** |

Deferred past v1: static analysis of `className` inside
`<Show>`/`<For>`/`<Index>`/`<Switch>`; the `changed()` macro interaction;
fine-grained `action` composition ordering (v1 fixes "user action runs after
Vela's"). Motion was on this list and landed in §9, on the same neutral
`__VelaMotion` the React host drives rather than on `spring()`.

Phases 1 and 2 are what make everything after them unable to regress the React path.

## 6. Phase 0 results

`apps/vide-harness` holds five cases taken verbatim from `transform()`'s React output
and ported to Vide, against a prototype of the Vide runtime in
`src/client/vela-vide.tsx`. All five were measured running in Studio.

**Confirmed**

- Static lowering output compiles and runs under Vide **unchanged**. Roblox property
  names, lowercase intrinsics and injected helper children all carry over.
- Rem scaling needs **no emit change at all**. `__VelaRem.scale(new UDim(0, 8), 0)`
  stays as written; Vide's `Derivable<T>` accepts the thunk the scaler returns where
  React accepted a `Binding`. Measured at a 1474px viewport: `CornerRadius` resolved to
  `(0, 6)` and `PaddingTop` to `(0, 12)` against raw `8` and `16`. `EmitTarget` loses
  its `rem_binding` method.
- Thunked `__velaTests` re-drive their rules with no re-render — the core risk of the
  whole design. A source flipping on a 1s period drove the element between
  `Color3.fromRGB(251, 44, 54)` and `Color3.fromRGB(43, 127, 255)`, and the rule's
  `BackgroundTransparency` override beat the static value.
- `hover:` works: driving the mouse onto the button moved it to the hover color and
  off it moved it back.
- Width rules work: at 1474px the `md` rule composed `SizeX` into `Size` as
  `{0.5, 0}, {0, 0}`.
- The type seam holds. `declare global { namespace Vide { interface Attributes } }`
  merges into Vide's UMD namespace and reaches intrinsics, components, and the
  `() => ClassValue` derivable form. Checked against a negative control.

**Found, not in the original design**

- `Vide.create()` passes the tag straight to `Instance.new()`, so a lowercase
  `__velaTag` dies there. Only `jsx.luau` carries the ReflectionService lowercase map.
  The Vide host must route through `jsx` — which also gets it the `action` and
  `*Changed` pass-through for free.
- `jsx` is missing from `@rbxts/vide`'s published `index.d.ts` even though it exists at
  runtime and is what `jsxFactory` points at. Worth an upstream issue; cast for now.
- `@rbxts/vide@0.6.1`'s `main` is `src/init.lua` but the file is `src/init.luau`.
  roblox-ts resolves it anyway.
- Package separation does not by itself keep React out of a Vide **place**. Rojo maps
  the whole `node_modules/@rbxts` directory, and under the hoisted linker that
  directory holds every scope package any workspace member pulled. `apps/vide-harness`
  copies only its own transitive `@rbxts` dependencies for this reason; consumer-facing
  docs will need the same warning.

## 7. Phase 1–2 results

The seam and the split both landed as designed, and both were proven to be no-ops
before anything Vide-specific was built on them.

- `EmitTarget` (`transform/target/`) carries seven methods. `rem_binding` is gone, as
  phase 0 predicted; `class_value_is_deferred` is new, because the arrow unwrap turned
  out to belong to the target rather than to `class_value/`.
- The React path was proven unchanged **byte for byte**: ten transform cases compared
  against the pre-refactor output.
- The runtime split is `@rbxts/vela-runtime-core` (neutral) with `@rbxts/vela-runtime`
  and `@rbxts/vela-runtime-vide` on top. 678 declarations were checked for a home; the
  React host came out at 827 lines from 5797.

**Found, not in the original design.** "45 React call sites" was the wrong measure of
coupling. Three pieces called no React API and were still React-shaped:

- `composeEvent` nests handlers under an `Event` table, which is `@rbxts/react`'s
  spelling. A Vide binding connects to the signal directly. Core grew neutral
  `hoverTracking` / `activeTracking` / `focusTracking` binding lists instead.
- `@rbxts/react` prepends the instance to handler arguments, so the active tracker read
  its `InputObject` from `args[1]`. Connected straight to the signal it arrives at
  `args[0]`. `hover:` hid this by ignoring its arguments entirely.
- `prepareMarginWrapper` hands the layout props over by mutating a description React
  creates from later. Vide applies props as it builds, so the handover has to happen
  before the instance exists or both carry them.

Anything moved to core is now worth re-reading for the same shape rather than for an
import.

## 8. Phase 3–4 results

Everything below was measured running in Studio, against the emit the transformer
produces for `framework: "vide"` — not a hand-port.

**Confirmed.** Static lowering, derivable class values (ternary, template remainder,
dictionary), rem on both the static and the host path, `hover:`, `active:`, `focus:`,
`md:`, `dark:`, inherited opacity across a component boundary, `m-*` wrappers,
`divide-*` separators, and helpers a rule brings into existence.

**Found, not in the original design**

- **Helpers cannot be built lazily.** The plan said the host would create and destroy a
  conditional helper imperatively. Vide's `assert_stable_scope` refuses to open a
  reactive scope inside another, and an instance with a thunked prop opens one — so a
  helper built inside the children effect throws. Every tag any rule could ask for is
  built up front instead, and the children thunk returns the subset the resolution
  currently names. Vide unparents the rest. `hover:rounded-lg` costs one UICorner that
  spends most of its life detached.
- **A helper's props follow the resolution, not the snapshot.** Built once from the
  untracked snapshot they freeze — and at creation the viewport is still 1×1, so rem
  freezes at a ratio of 1. This is invisible under a variant probe, because the variant
  reads the same environment under test; it took a derivable class value to surface.
- **A composer needs the element's own props.** `applyComposedResolution` fills the axis
  a rule left out from `hostProps.Size`. The React host seeds that table with the
  element's statics; the Vide host started from an empty one, so `md:w-1/2` beside a
  static `h-6` resolved to a height of zero. Position and AnchorPoint compose the same
  way.
- **Rule effects can name a prop no instance has.** `md:w-1/2` writes `SizeX`, which the
  composers fold into `Size`. Bound straight through it reaches the instance and
  `SizeX is not a valid member of Frame` takes the tree down.
- **`__velaMargin` and `__velaDivide` are the host's own props.** Left in the static
  passthrough they land on the instance and throw.
- Vide hands a component its children as the node itself, or as a plain array when
  there is more than one. Divide has to open those arrays — but only the plain ones, as
  an action is a table too and it is the metatable that tells them apart.

**Verification note.** `apps/*/node_modules/@rbxts/vela-runtime-*` is a copy the
materialize script makes, not a symlink. Rebuilding a runtime package and then running
`rbxtsc` alone leaves that copy stale, and Studio keeps serving the old runtime through
a reconnect. The order is: build the runtime, materialize, `rbxtsc`, restart `rojo`.

## 9. Parity pass results

A read of the two hosts side by side against what the transformer actually emits
for `framework: "vide"`. The static path was already at parity; everything below
was on the runtime host path.

**Fixed.**

- **The host's own props were not all filtered.** `__velaTransition`,
  `__velaAnimation` and `__velaText` are emitted for every target, and only
  `__velaMargin`/`__velaDivide` had been named in the Vide passthrough — the
  other three reached `Instance` and threw there. They are one
  `HOST_OWN_PROPS` set now, so a new one cannot be missed a name at a time.
  `apps/vide-harness` never caught it because its `uppercase` probe is a literal
  `Text` on an otherwise static class list, which the compiler transforms itself.
- **A rule that stopped matching wrote nil.** Every prop a rule can name is
  bound, and Vide writes what the thunk returns — so a variant with no static
  counterpart (`hover:font-bold` on an element that declares no `FontFace`)
  wrote `nil` to the instance the moment it was created. React drops the prop
  and the reconciler restores the class default; the fallback reads that default
  off one unparented probe instance per class. Every harness variant probe had a
  static base, which is why this was invisible too.
- **The inherited alpha composed once per bound prop.** `composeInheritedOpacity`
  mutates the resolution in place and is not idempotent, and every bound prop's
  thunk read the same memoized table. It moved into the `derive`.
- **A component tag lost its children.** They were numbered into the array part
  of the props table, which is where a *host* tag reads them; Vide hands a
  component `children`.
- **Every dynamic class value grew a margin wrapper.** The wrap was decided by
  `className !== undefined` rather than by a margin, so an extra frame and
  `uipadding` sat between the element and its parent's layout, with the layout
  props moved onto the wrapper. It follows the resolved margin now, the way
  `divide` already followed the resolved divide.
- **Text and motion.** `applyTextConfig` runs in the resolved-prop path, so
  `uppercase`/`underline` reach a runtime host. `transition-*` binds a covered
  prop to a per-prop effect that tweens rather than writes — the first reading is
  what the instance is created holding — and `animate-*` starts a preset under
  `cleanup()`. Both drive the same neutral `__VelaMotion` the React host does,
  so a `plugins.motion` driver covers both targets.
- **The fade consumer reached only the root.** React's `applyAlpha` recurses
  through children; the Vide one wrote the one instance it was handed. It walks
  the subtree now, stops at a `CanvasGroup` whose own `GroupTransparency`
  already carries the fade, and skips what a runtime host already faded for
  itself — the mark standing in for the element type React recognizes.
- **Target inference.** D3's tsconfig `jsxFactory` fallback had never landed.
  `defineConfig` resolves an unset framework to the default, so whether the
  project named one is read off the input rather than the result.

## 10. Opacity pass results

The parity pass left three holes, all in the same seam: React has one context
that both the host and the fade consumer read, while Vide has two disjoint
mechanisms — the host's `__velaOpacity` and a consumer that walks instances —
and the mark that keeps them from overlapping dropped exactly these.

Each was measured in Studio against what the React host computes for the same
element, and all three now agree with it.

- **The context's alpha never reached a prop the element was handed.**
  `composeInheritedOpacity` only touches names the resolution already carries, so
  a written `BackgroundTransparency={0}` under a component-boundary fade stayed
  opaque. The channels are composed onto the declared props too now, and bound
  whether or not anything named them — a channel that was never set still
  paints.
- **A component the host renders got nothing.** Every alpha the host applies was
  behind a `hostTag !== undefined` guard. A component's body runs inside the
  host, though, which is the one place a real Vide context scope still opens
  around a subtree — so it is opened there.
- **A host's own children got nothing from an `opacity-*` it resolved.** React
  wraps them in a provider they read during their own render, which a child
  built before its parent cannot do. The alpha is written onto what they built
  instead, against a remembered base so a resolution that changes it does not
  compound, skipping any subtree a nested host provides for itself and stopping
  at a `CanvasGroup` that already composites its own.

**Packaging.** `vela-rbxts` depended on `@rbxts/react` and `@rbxts/vela-runtime`
outright, so a Vide project installed both — and Rojo maps the whole
`node_modules/@rbxts` directory into the place, which is the trap §6 recorded.
Both hosts (and both UI libraries) are optional peers now, so a project installs
only the one it emits for.

## 11. Lifting the snapshot

Everything above still read its shape off one untracked reading: which props
were bound, which states were tracked, whether there was a divide. A token only
a later reading of a deferred `className` produced could not take effect. That
came from binding a **thunk per prop name**, which forces the names to be known
before the instance exists.

A host tag is an instance the host owns, so it does not have to be. The thunks
were replaced with **one effect that writes what the resolution now names** —
which is what a re-render is for React. Nothing about the prop set is decided in
advance: a name that appears is written, a name that disappears is restored to
what the element declared, or to the class default where it declared nothing.
Tweens moved into the same write, and the `bound`/`tweened` sets are gone.

The rest followed. Trackers attach unconditionally when the class value is
deferred, because a `hover:` the first reading did not name is exactly the case
a fixed tracker set would lose — for a class list this pass can read, the
snapshot is still exact and nothing extra is connected. Separators are built up
front like the helpers are, one fewer than the children that take a layout slot,
and the children thunk returns the run the resolution currently asks for.

**Found while doing it.** `declaredProps` read every static through
`readDerivable`, which calls a function — and in Vide an event handler and a
derivable prop are both plain functions. A `MouseButton1Click` on any element
with a dynamic class value was being *called* on every resolution reading. Vide
tells the two apart by asking the instance whether the property is a signal;
here the class-default probe answers the same question, and it covers `action`
and the `*Changed` names too, neither of which is a member at all.

**The margin box.** The one effect that genuinely cannot be applied after the
fact: the box a margin needs is an instance *above* the element, and the element
is parented as soon as it is built. So it is not applied after the fact — the
compiler says up front that one is coming. `EmitTarget::needs_margin_box_hint`
is what asks; a class value naming a margin anywhere this pass can read (a
static token, a branch's) emits `__velaMarginBox`, and the host builds the box
before the element. React answers `false`, because the render that resolves a
margin also renders the wrapper around it.

What that leaves is a margin named only where nothing can read it — a token that
arrives out of an opaque call. The runtime warns there rather than rendering it
unspaced.

**Still open**

- On a component element the prop names are still fixed when it is called: it is
  handed its props once rather than written to, so they have to be derivables.
  A host element has no such limit.
- A margin that only an unreadable source names, per above.
- `@rbxts/vela-runtime-core` and `@rbxts/vela-runtime-vide` are new npm packages and
  need their own OIDC trusted publishers configured before the next release.

**Not a limit, contrary to the earlier note.** `className` inside `<Show>` /
`<For>` / `<Index>` / `<Switch>` *is* analyzed: the transformer visits nested
JSX whatever encloses it, so a child of one of those lowers exactly as the same
element does on its own — statics, rules, deferred remainder and all.
