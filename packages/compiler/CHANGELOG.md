# @vela-rbxts/compiler

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 04c4e35: Diagnostic quality: malformed `configJson` now reports `invalid-config-json` instead of silently falling back to the default theme, TSX parse failures carry line/column and a source range instead of a debug dump, and an invalid `vela.config.*` export names the failing theme key. The compiler root tarball also stops bundling the publish machine's native binary — platform packages already provide them.
- b5714bc: Fix two runtime host defects: breakpoint and orientation variants never matched because `Camera.ViewportSize` was only read at mount while it still reports 1x1, and `divide-*` counted lowered helper elements as content, placing a separator above the first child.
